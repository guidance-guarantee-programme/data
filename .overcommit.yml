# Use this file to configure the Overcommit hooks you wish to use. This will
# extend the default configuration defined in:
# https://github.com/brigade/overcommit/blob/master/config/default.yml
#
# At the topmost level of this YAML file is a key representing type of hook
# being run (e.g. pre-commit, commit-msg, etc.). Within each type you can
# customise each hook, such as whether to only run it on certain files (via
# `include`), whether to only display output if it fails (via `quiet`), etc.
#
# For a complete list of hooks, see:
# https://github.com/brigade/overcommit/tree/master/lib/overcommit/hook
#
# For a complete list of options that you can use to customise hooks, see:
# https://github.com/brigade/overcommit#configuration
#
# Uncomment the following lines to make the configuration take effect.

PreCommit:
  RuboCop:
    enabled: true
    on_warn: fail # Treat all warnings as failures
    required_executable: './bin/rubocop'

  TrailingWhitespace:
    enabled: true

PostCheckout:
  ALL: # Special hook name that customises all hooks of this type
    quiet: true # Change all post-checkout hooks to only display output on failure

  IndexTags:
    enabled: true # Generate a tags file with `ctags` each time HEAD changes
